-create a readme
-add ability to read in a series of commands when calling the function
    -kind of like a tcl file
    -ability to call program, pass in options, without having to get into the entire terminal
        probably will need a ltspice_addon.py module that checks for arguments and runs them, but the default will be to call the terminal

DONE -run all of the standard commands using pyautogui
-then run all of the basic commands using python libraries
-then add tolerances




-Create some basic commands, run op point, change parameter, run LTSpice, open LTSpice, etc.
    -create needed parsers
-Add more analysis tools to the toolset
    -regression analysis of waveforms
    -tolerance analysis of components
-Add to PyPi index

-check out similar libraries and resources:
    https://pypi.org/project/ltspice/
    https://pypi.org/project/PySpice/
    https://pypi.org/project/spiceypy/
    https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/spiceypy/master/spiceypy.pdf

-Add self designing tools?
    -BJT amp designer?
    -framework for making your own template design?
-Add gui interface? for these additional commands?

-Add functionality for both windows and linux. Make sure to support both platforms
